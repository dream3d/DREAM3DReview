Find Mask Neighbors 
=============

## Group (Subgroup) ##

DREAM3D Review (Spatial)

## Description ##

This **Filter** determines whether a **Feature** touches a masked **Cell**, where the mask is supplied by the user. (FIXME) This is accomplished by simply querying the **Feature** owners of the **Cells** and determining if an adjacent cell is a masked cell. If so, the feature is flagged as a mask neighor.

This **Filter** determines whether a **Feature** touches a masked **Cell**. A **Feature** is considered touching a masked **Cell** if the following condition is met:

+ Any cell has **Mask = True** as a neighbor.

The output of this filter is a **Feature** level array of booleans where 0=Not Touching Masked Data and 1=Touching Masked Data.

### 2D Image Geometry ###

If the structure/data is actually 2D, then the dimension that is planar is not considered and only the **Features** touching the edges are considered surface **Features**.


## Parameters ##

None
