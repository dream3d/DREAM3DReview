# Compute Eigenstrains by Feature (Grain/Inclusion) #

DREAM3DReview (DREAM3DReview)

## Description ##

This **Filter** calculates the eigenstrain tensor of each **Feature** by using Poisson's ratio, **Feature** shape information, and elastic strain tensor information. This filter was developed alongside Ref. [1]. 

For each **Feature**, the Eshelby tensor is calculated using the solution for Eshelby's isotropic inclusion given by Mura [2]. If *Use Ellipsoidal Grains* is enabled, the elliptic integrals used to calculate the Eshelby tensor are numerically approximated using 32-point Gaussian quadrature. Otherwise, the tensor is exact when grains are assumed to be spherical. The eigenstrain tensor is then calculated using the known relation between Eshelby's tensor and the elastic strain tensor [2]. The correctional matrix can be used to emperically correct the eigenstrains using the approaches from Refs. [3] and [4].
